# remote-job-board

A developer that I have been following a long time and admire is Indie Solopreneur [Pieter Levels](https://twitter.com/levelsio) who is the creator of [NomadList](https://nomadlist.com/) and [Remote Ok](https://remoteok.com/).

In this project, I am recreating a simple remote job board using Remote Ok's [API](https://remoteok.com/api)

I am also doing this project to solidify and bringing my learning with HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript all together.
